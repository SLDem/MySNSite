# MySNSite
This is my 3rd site project, its highly based on Miguel Grinberg's microblog(about 7 first commits). THe main purpose of this project
is for me to learn basic standards and concepts of web-application biulding and database maintaining, i'm using robohash avatars
because they are way cooler than gravatars.
